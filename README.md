# **Collaboration Tool - Final Submission**

## **Project Overview**

The **Collaboration Tool** is a full-stack web application developed to enhance team collaboration, streamline project management, and improve productivity. Designed with developers and teams in mind, the tool facilitates effective collaboration on software development projects by providing core features such as task management, real-time communication, project organization, and file sharing. The application is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), ensuring scalability, performance, and ease of use.

With this tool, teams can work together seamlessly, share files, track tasks, communicate in real-time, and organize projects more efficiently, all from a centralized platform.

## **Features**

### **1. User Authentication**
- **Secure Login and Registration**: Enables users to sign up and log in securely to the application.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admins and regular users have different levels of access and control.
- **User Profile Management**: Users can view and update their profile details and manage security settings.

### **2. Real-Time Communication**
- **Instant Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages in real-time with team members, ensuring seamless communication.
- **Message Notifications**: Users are notified of incoming messages to stay updated.

### **5. File Sharing**
- **Easy File Uploads**: Users can upload and share files within a project or task.
- **File Version Control**: Track different versions of files to ensure users are always working on the most recent version.
- **File Attachments**: Attach files directly to tasks for context and reference.

### **6. Notifications**
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Receive instant alerts for task assignments, updates, messages, and project changes.
- **Email Alerts**: Critical updates such as task deadlines or important messages can also trigger email notifications.

### **7. Task Dashboard**
- **Visual Dashboard**: Provides an overview of task progress, showing which tasks are pending, in progress, or completed.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Visualize task progress with charts and progress bars to monitor team performance and project health.

- **User-Friendly UI**: A clean, modern interface for a smooth user experience.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend (Client-Side)**
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Redux**: For managing the applicationâ€™s state across various components.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and mobile-first design.
- **Socket.io Client**: To enable real-time communication and messaging between users.

### **Backend (Server-Side)**
- **Node.js**: A runtime for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js, used to build the backend RESTful API.
- **Socket.io**: Facilitates real-time, two-way communication between the client and the server.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data like user profiles, tasks, projects, and messages.
- **Mongoose**: A MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, simplifying database operations.

### **Authentication**
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used to securely transmit user information for authentication and authorization.
- **bcrypt.js**: A library for hashing passwords securely before storing them in the database.
